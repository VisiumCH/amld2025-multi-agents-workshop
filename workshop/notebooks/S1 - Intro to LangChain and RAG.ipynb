(WPRO) , India ’s third-largest software exporter, reported first-quarter profit rose 2.5 percent as demand for information-technology services increased. Net income rose to 16.2 billion rupees ($275 million) in the three months ended June, matching the median of 38 analysts’s estimate compiled by Bloomberg. The Bangalore-based company posted sales of 97.3 billion rupees, that missed the 99.3 billion-rupee median of analysts’ estimates. Wipro’s revenue from information-technology services matched the forecast range it provided in April. Billionaire Chairman Azim Premji said the company is seeing higher confidence among its customers amid “positive macroeconomic developments,” particularly in the U.S. -- its biggest market. Wipro joins larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) in signaling higher demand for outsourced software work by forecasting revenue from the business to rise as much as $1.65 billion in the quarter ending September. “The guidance is a significant jump over this quarter’s expectations,” said Amar Mourya, a Mumbai-based analyst with India Nivesh Securities. “That could lead to a re-rating and revision in the full-year stock price” target, he said. The forecast for IT revenue in the second quarter is based on 57.24 rupees to a U.S. dollar, the company said in a statement yesterday. Meeting Forecast Its revenue from IT services increased to $1.59 billion in the quarter ended June, in line with its April forecast of $1.575 billion to $1.61 billion for the period. Shares of Wipro rose 1.5 percent to 381.95 rupees at the close in Mumbai trading before the earnings announcement yesterday. The stock has climbed 8.6 percent this year, compared with a 1.7 percent advance in the S&P BSE Sensex. Salary increases to its employees squeezed operating margins in the quarter, according to Chief Financial Officer Suresh Senapaty. “We continue to maintain our sector underperformer call on Wipro owing to its dismal performance and sustained underperformace,” Rahul Jain, an analyst with Mumbai-based Dolat Capital Market Pvt. said in a note yesterday. “We believe that stock would deliver lower growth compared to peers.” The company added 28 new customers in the quarter, it said. Wipro added 1,469 people in the period, bringing the total number of employees to 147,281. “We are seeing a pickup in large deal closures which has reflected in strong order book in the current quarter,” T.K.

       "Indian (SENSEX) stocks fell for the first time in five days as some investors judged last week’s rally may have outpaced the outlook for interest rate cuts by the central bank. The S&P BSE Sensex lost 0.4 percent to 19,608.76 at the 3:30 p.m. preliminary close in Mumbai. Volumes on the measure were 15 percent below the 30-day average. Hero Motocorp Ltd. (HMCL) , India biggest motorcycle maker, fell for the first time in five days. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , India’s largest software services exporter, paced decline among its peers. The Sensex jumped 4 percent last week, its steepest weekly gain since November, amid speculation the Reserve Bank of India will cut interest rates at its policy review on March 19. That pushed the gauge’s valuation to 13.8 times projected 12-month profits , compared with 13.3 times at the end of February, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “Valuations have gone up again as expectations of a rate cut is getting built in,” Mehraboon Jamshed Irani, principal and head of private client group at Nirmal Bang Securities in Mumbai, told Bloomberg TV India today. The Sensex fell for five straight weeks through March 1, reaching a three-month low on Feb. 28, as profits at companies from Tata Motors (TTMT) to State Bank of India trailed estimates for the December quarter and a government report showed that the pace of the economic growth in the final three months of 2012 was the weakest in almost four years. Overseas funds bought a net $127 million worth of stocks on March 7, taking their net investment in local equities this year to $8.73 billion, a record for the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They bought a net $24.5 billion worth of shares last year, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.\n",

       "Apple Will Announce Plans for Cash Hoard, Gamco Says: Tom Keene\n",
       "\n",
       "Apple Inc. (AAPL) will outline what it plans to do with a growing pile of cash by next month, according to Howard Ward, chief investment officer at Gamco Investors Inc. (GBL)  Apple, which has been grappling with investor criticism over the handling of its $137.1 billion in cash and investments , will add $42 billion in earnings to that sum in 2013, Ward said. Greenlight Capital Inc.’s David Einhorn has been urging Cupertino, California-based Apple to issue high-yielding preferred shares to spread the funds among investors. Investors are also urging Apple to consider a higher dividend payout. “We’re going to get an announcement from the company as to how they intend to reallocate some of their cash,” Ward said in an interview today on Bloomberg Radio ’s “Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “They will put a floor under their stock at a higher price than it is today.” Apple climbed 1.4 percent to $437.87 at the close in New York, leaving the shares down 18 percent this year, compared with an 9.1 percent increase in the S&P 500 Index. Keith Goddard , president of Capital Advisors Inc., said Apple will probably announce a dividend or buyback by the end of the year, possibly as early as April, when the company is scheduled to release second-quarter earnings. “It really is mind-boggling to me that they’re being so stubborn about sitting on so much cash,” said Goddard, who said his firm owns 23,100 Apple shares. Apple has said it’s in active discussions over how to manage the cash, and that it’s considering buybacks, a bigger dividend among other options. Ward compared Apple’s shares to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) stock a year ago, after the bank announced a multibillion-dollar loss at the hands of one trader. “The stock was beaten up and it was at 30 dollars a share, and now it’s 50,” he said. Apple is the largest holding in Gamco’s (GBL) fund, Ward said.\n"
