The investment office “will be looking to manage more funds, in more asset classes, and in more regions of the world in the near future,” he said. The KIA, which has about $342 billion of assets according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute in California , holds stakes in Daimler AG and BP Plc.

(AAPL) ’s iPhones, predicts a shift in demand toward lower-priced smartphones will help boost royalty revenue. “There is a shift advantage for ARM as mid-range and entry smartphones drive smartphone growth. We’ve got that dynamic going into next year,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Score said at a conference in Barcelona yesterday. “Those phones generate much more royalty for ARM because they use more silicon.” ARM has had five consecutive years of revenue growth as its designs for chips that control graphics and processing were used in increasingly popular smartphones and tablets. Royalty payments took the spotlight last quarter as they missed analysts’ estimates. ARM shares have fallen almost 9 percent since the earnings report on Oct. 22. “As ARM technology becomes more sophisticated, the royalty percentage goes up,” Score said. “On average, it’s going to very gradually go up.” Global smartphone shipments surged 40 percent last quarter, slowing from 53 percent growth for the previous three-month period, according to researcher IDC. The average selling prices of the devices fell by 13 percent to $317 from a year earlier, because of demand for more affordable handsets. In spite of concerns about slowing growth, especially in China, Score said ARM can continue expanding its customer base and outperforming the semiconductor market in the next five years, driven by cheaper handsets, enterprise networking and micro-controllers. ARM shares fell less than 1 percent to 953.50 pence at 9:16 a.m. in London. New Chief Chief Executive Officer Simon Segars, who succeeded Warren East in July, is confronting a shift in the industry’s growth to low-end smartphones and new entrant Intel Corp. (INTC) , which has begun designing its own chips for mobile phones. ARM, based in Cambridge, England, is also seeking to boost its market share in servers as companies from Facebook Inc. (FB) to Google Inc. (GOOG) look for lower-power machines to drive their data centers. It’s “possible to identify such a market and build a chip specifically for that market, whether it is to handle only storage or only video loading, for example. We can make the chip much more efficient,” Score said at the annual Technology, Media and Telecoms Conference organized by Morgan Stanley. “Everyone knows Intel has a very strong ecosystem around servers, we’re not kidding ourselves,” Score said. “For that reason we see it as further out.”'),\n",

(GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) about selling shares in a public offering as early as this year. The company, which has its headquarters in Orlando , Florida , as well as in London , plans to select bankers this year after introducing a service that will provide easier access to its app platforms, Chief Executive Officer Raj Koneru said in an interview yesterday. The share sale will take place this year or in 2014, he said. “We are talking with a lot of bankers,” Koneru said. The company hasn’t decided how much stock to sell or the amount of funds to raise, he said. Kony, which has yet to make a profit, expects to record $80 million to $100 million in revenue this year, about double its 2012 sales, Koneru said. An initial public offering could raise at least $120 million for Kony, valuing the company at more than $700 million, Tom Taulli , an analyst who covers IPOs, said in an interview. “Enterprise is really hot right now,” Taulli said. “Right place at the right time -- that always helps with an IPO. I suspect they’ll do well.” Spending on app-development tools for multiple mobile operating systems will grow at an average annual rate of 39 percent to reach $8.2 billion in 2016, according to Smith’s Point Analytics LLC. Founded in 2007, Kony sells annual subscriptions for its app platform-service, which allows developers to customize products to their own specifications. The company has raised about $35 million from Georgian Partners and Insight Venture Partners and may use proceeds from an IPO to improve its software and for research and development, Koneru said.'),\n",

(HPQ) rose to the highest price in 10 months after Morgan Stanley upgraded the shares, citing the potential for the company to return more cash to investors. The shares advanced 2.9 percent to $22.83 at the close in New York, the highest since May 14. The stock has gained 60 percent this year, compared with an 8.8 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Hewlett-Packard may generate free cash flow of about $6.7 billion in the 2013 fiscal year, almost 35 percent more than the company’s $5 billion forecast, according to Katy Huberty, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. As Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman works to revive growth amid a slump in sales of personal-computers, restructuring may result in $2.2 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2014, Huberty said. “Cash return in the form of a buyback or higher dividend is a likely scenario,” Huberty wrote in a research report today. She upgraded the shares with a buy recommendation and a $27 target price. “Even without revenue growth, we expect HP to grow earnings per share and free cash flow over the next three years.” Hewlett-Packard’s core personal-computer business is shrinking because of competition from lower-priced rivals such as China’s Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) and demand for mobile devices made by companies including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Hewlett-Packard’s enterprise business also is being undermined as companies look for more Internet-based cloud services. Whitman last September said the Palo Alto , California-based company planned to cut 29,000 jobs through the end of the 2014 fiscal year.')]"

       "Digital China Unit Plans $492 Million Merger With Shenzhen Techo\n",
       "\n",
       "Digital China Holdings Ltd. (861) , a distributor of technology products, said its information services unit will merge with Shenzhen Techo Telecom Co. (000555) in a 3.02 billion yuan ($492 million) all-stock deal. Shenzhen Techo will absorb Digital China Information Service Co. in exchange for 319.6 million new shares, about a 74 percent stake of its expanded share capital, Digital China said yesterday in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing. The merger gives Digital China a separate listing for its systems integration, applications software development and professional IT services business, according to the filing. Its distribution operations have been affected by a drop in consumer demand, Miles Xie, an analyst at Bocom International Holdings Ltd., wrote in a June report. The deal is deemed a spinoff under Stock Exchange of Hong Kong rules and will require approval from the exchange, Shenzhen Techo shareholders and Chinese government regulatory agencies, Digital China said. After the merger, Shenzhen Techo plans to discontinue its existing operations, the trading of liquid crystal film display panel products, according to the filing. Digital China said it will continue to distribute IT products and provide supply chain services. Digital China, which now owns 61 percent of the services unit, will hold a 45.2 percent in Shenzhen Techo, according to the filing. Tianjin Xinrui Investment Partnership LP, which owns 18.6 percent of the unit, will get a 13.8 percent stake in Shenzhen Techo, the company said. Unit investors China Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Ventures Co., Infinity I-China Investments Israel LP and Nanjing Huiqing Tianxia Technology Co. will get stakes of 12.3 percent, 2.2 percent and 0.7 percent respectively, according to the filing. Digital China gained 1.4 percent to HK$8.64 at the close of Hong Kong trading yesterday, before the announcement. The stock has slumped 35 percent this year, compared with the 2.5 percent decline in the city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index. Shenzhen Techo has been suspended from trading in Shenzhen since May 6.\n",

       "Northern Trust Profit Rises 1.7% as Market Boosts Assets\n",
       "\n",
       "Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) , the third- biggest independent U.S. custody bank, said first-quarter profit rose 1.7 percent as stock-market gains boosted the value of assets the company oversees. Net income increased to $164 million, or 67 cents per diluted share, from $161.2 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier, the Chicago-based company said today in a statement. Results missed the 72-cent average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. “We have a better macro backdrop with higher market levels this quarter, and we saw good organic growth across all three” of the largest publicly listed custody banks, Brian Bedell, a New York-based analyst at ISI Group Inc., said in an interview before results were released. The custody banks, under pressure to improve profitability hurt by record-low interest rates, are benefiting as global equity markets climb for the second straight year. Northern Trust, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frederick H. Waddell, followed larger rivals Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) and State Street Corp. (STT) with job cuts in 2012 that, combined with technology initiatives, are designed to increase annual pretax income by $250 million by the end of this year. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) of U.S. stocks returned 14 percent in the 12 months ended March 31, and global stocks, as measured by the MSCI ACWI Index, advanced 11 percent, with reinvested dividends. Rate Impact Low rates hurt custody banks by reducing the return they make on lending and on their own investments. The U.S. Federal Reserve has held its benchmark interest rate at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 in an attempt to stimulate borrowing and economic growth. Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend securities for institutional investors, including mutual funds, pension funds and hedge funds. Northern Trust also manages investments for individuals and institutions. Results were announced before the start of regular U.S. trading. Northern Trust gained 7.3 percent this year through yesterday, compared with a 15 percent advance by the Standard & Poor’s 20-company index of asset managers and custody banks. BNY Mellon is scheduled to released earnings tomorrow, followed by State Street on April 19. (Northern Trust is scheduled to hold a conference call for investors at 10 a.m. New York time. The call can be accessed at http://www.northerntrust/financialreleases .)\n"
